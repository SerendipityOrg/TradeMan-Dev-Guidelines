# Project Setup Guidelines

Welcome to our project! This document outlines the standardized guidelines to ensure consistency and quality in our development process. Here you'll find detailed steps for starting new projects, coding conventions, and reference materials.

## 1. Project Initialization

### 1.1 Planning a New Project
Before diving into code, it's essential to plan your approach:
- Define the project's scope.
- Identify the primary objectives and expected outcomes.
- Determine the resources required.

### 1.2 Requirements Specifications
Proper documentation of requirements is crucial for clarity and scope management:
- **Product Requirements Documentation (PRD):** Outline the functionalities, user interface, and user experience.
- **System Requirements:**
  - **High-Level Design (HLD):** Include infrastructure requirements and capacity/load estimations.
  
### 1.3 System Design
System design is vital for understanding the overall architecture and interactions:
- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD):** Visualize the flow of data within the system.
- **Application Flow Diagrams:** Chart the steps a user takes through the application.
- **Class Diagrams:** Outline entities and their relationships.
- **Database Schema Design:** Detail the database structure.
- **High-level Infrastructure Design:** Describe the system's infrastructure setup.

### 1.4 Project Execution Planning
Efficient project execution requires detailed planning:
- Enumerate all modules and functionalities.
- Develop timelines and milestones.
- Finalize and approve all requirements.

## 2. Coding Conventions and Guidelines

### 2.1 Git Workflow Guidelines
Maintain a consistent Git workflow:
- Feature branching.
- Pull requests for reviews.
- Commit message standards.

### 2.2 CI/CD Guidelines
Continuous Integration and Deployment streamline the development:
- **Releases Documentation (`releases.md`):** Guidelines on how to manage and document releases.
- **CI/CD Tools Documentation:** Outline tools used and configurations.

### 2.3 Project & File Structure Guidelines
Define a clear directory and file structure to maintain organization across the team.

### 2.4 Coding Guidelines
Adhere to coding standards to ensure readability and maintainability:
- Naming conventions.
- Code commenting practices.
- Linting rules (adhere to tools like ESLint, Flake8).

### 2.5 Documentation Guidelines
Documentation is critical for onboarding and future maintenance:
- Inline documentation for complex logic.
- Use tools like ReadTheDocs or GitBook to keep documentation accessible and updated.

# Standard Operating Procedure: Creating Product Requirements Documentation (PRD)

This SOP outlines the process for creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Documentation (PRD), focusing on understanding the problem statement, identifying customer pain points, collaborating with stakeholders, and iteratively refining the product concept.

## 1. Understanding Problem Statement and Product to be Built

### Approach 1: Problem Statement Workshop

#### Workflow:
1. Gather key stakeholders (product managers, engineers, designers)
2. Conduct a facilitated workshop to define the problem
3. Use techniques like the "5 Whys" to dig deeper into the root cause
4. Collaboratively draft a problem statement
5. Refine and finalize the statement

#### Example:
For a new project management tool:
- Initial statement: "Teams struggle with project coordination"
- After "5 Whys" analysis: "Distributed teams lack real-time visibility into task dependencies, leading to missed deadlines and duplicated work"
- Final problem statement: "Create a project management tool that provides real-time task dependency tracking and visualization for distributed teams, reducing missed deadlines by 30% and eliminating work duplication"

### Approach 2: Market Research Analysis

#### Workflow:
1. Conduct comprehensive market research
2. Analyze competitor products and their shortcomings
3. Identify market gaps and opportunities
4. Draft a product vision based on findings
5. Validate the vision with stakeholders

#### Example:
For a new health tracking app:
- Market research finding: Existing apps focus on step counting but neglect overall wellness
- Competitor analysis: Limited integration of mental health features
- Market gap: Holistic health tracking combining physical and mental wellness
- Product vision: "Create an AI-driven health companion that provides personalized insights by integrating physical activity, nutrition, sleep, and mental wellbeing data"

## 2. Identifying Customer Pain Points

### Approach 1: User Interviews

#### Workflow:
1. Identify target user segments
2. Develop an interview script focusing on daily challenges
3. Conduct one-on-one interviews with users
4. Analyze interview transcripts to identify common pain points
5. Categorize and prioritize pain points

#### Example:
For a home automation system:
- Interview question: "What's the most frustrating part of managing your home environment?"
- User response: "I never know if I've left appliances on when I leave for work"
- Identified pain point: Lack of remote monitoring and control of home appliances
- Requirement: "Implement a mobile app interface for remote monitoring and control of all connected home appliances"

### Approach 2: Customer Journey Mapping

#### Workflow:
1. Define the scope of the customer journey
2. Identify key touchpoints in the journey
3. Map out the actions, thoughts, and feelings at each touchpoint
4. Identify pain points and moments of frustration
5. Brainstorm solutions for each pain point

#### Example:
For an e-commerce platform:
- Journey stage: Product return process
- Pain point identified: Customers frustrated with printing return labels
- Customer thought: "I don't have a printer at home, this is inconvenient"
- Solution: "Implement a label-less return system using QR codes that can be displayed on the customer's mobile device"

## 3. Collaborating with Stakeholders for Application Prototypes

### Approach 2: Iterative Wireframing Sessions

#### Workflow:
1. UX researcher presents user insights to the team
2. UI designer creates initial low-fidelity wireframes
3. Conduct weekly review sessions with stakeholders
4. Iteratively refine wireframes based on feedback
5. Graduate to high-fidelity prototypes
6. Document evolution of design and key decisions in PRD

#### Example:
For a personal finance management app:
- Initial wireframe: Basic dashboard with spending categories
- Stakeholder feedback: Need more emphasis on savings goals
- Iteration 1: Added a prominent savings goal tracker
- User feedback: Desire for more visual representation of progress
- Final prototype: Dashboard with interactive savings goal charts and celebrate milestone animations
- PRD documentation: "Savings goal feature must include interactive visual trackers and positive reinforcement for milestones, as shown in prototype version 3.2"

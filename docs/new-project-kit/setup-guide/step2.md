1. Go to the [templates repositories page](/new-project-kit/templates_repos/) and click on the docs repository.
2. Click on the "Use this template" button on Github.
3. Choose a name for the new repository and click on "Create repository from template".
4. Create a [docs repository]() first by clicking on the "Use this template" button on Github for the docs template repository.
5. Use the [Ideation worksheet](/new-project-kit/discovery_and_ideation_worksheet_template/) to iterate and finalize on the features and fill up the PRD & TDD.
6. Lastly, repeat the process for each template repository you need (e.g. code repositories like flutter-app, react-app, react-admin-app, backend, etc.).

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Docs repository created
- [ ] Ideation worksheet is filled up with features and the PRD & TDD are updated

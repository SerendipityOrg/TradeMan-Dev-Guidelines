## ðŸ’» Step 3: Setup CI/CD

1. Go to [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and enable Github Actions for your project.
2. Create a new workflow file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.
3. Choose a suitable workflow template for your project (e.g., Flutter, React, Node.js, etc.).
4. Customize the workflow file according to your project's needs.
5. Commit and push the workflow file to your repository.
6. Github Actions will automatically run the workflow on every push to the default branch.
7. Configure additional workflows as needed (e.g., for testing, deployment).

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Github Actions enabled
- [ ] Workflow file created and committed
- [ ] Additional workflows configured (if needed)

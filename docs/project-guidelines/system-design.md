- Show how data is processed at various stages.

## App Flow Diagrams

App flow diagrams should:

- Outline the user flow through the application.
- Highlight key screens and interactions.
- Identify navigation paths and decision points.

## Class Diagrams (Entities)

Class diagrams should:

- Define the key entities in the system.
- Show the relationships between entities.
- Include attributes and methods for each class.

## Database Schema Design

The database schema design should:

- Define the tables and their relationships.
- Specify the fields and data types for each table.
- Include indexes, constraints, and keys.

## 1. Introduction

This SOP outlines the process for defining System Requirements through High-Level Design (HLD) and Infrastructure Requirements, including Capacity/Load Estimation and long-term infrastructure planning. This document is crucial for ensuring that the system is designed to meet current needs and can scale effectively as the product grows.

## 2. High-Level Design (HLD)

### Objective
Create a high-level architectural design that outlines the overall structure of the system.

### Process
1. **Gather Inputs**
   - Review Product Requirements Document (PRD)
   - Analyze user stories and use cases
   - Consult with stakeholders (Product Managers, Engineers, Designers)

2. **Define System Components**
   - Identify major system modules
   - Outline key services and their responsibilities
   - Determine data stores and their purposes

3. **Create System Architecture Diagram**
   - Use architecture modeling tools (e.g., draw.io, Lucidchart)
   - Show components and their interactions
   - Include external systems and integrations

4. **Define Data Flow**
   - Create high-level data flow diagrams
   - Identify key data entities and their relationships
   - Outline data processing and transformation steps

5. **Specify Technology Stack**
   - Select programming languages
   - Choose frameworks and libraries
   - Determine database technologies
   - Identify third-party services and APIs

6. **Document Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Performance expectations
   - Scalability requirements
   - Security considerations
   - Reliability and availability targets

### Example Output
- System architecture diagram showing frontend, backend services, databases, and external integrations
- High-level data flow diagram
- Technology stack specification (e.g., React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, AWS hosting)
- List of non-functional requirements (e.g., 99.9% uptime, <100ms API response time)

## 3. Infrastructure Requirements

### Objective
Define the necessary infrastructure components to support the system design.

### Process
1. **Analyze System Architecture**
   - Review the HLD document
   - Identify infrastructure needs for each component

2. **Define Compute Requirements**
   - Determine server types (physical, virtual, containerized)
   - Specify CPU and RAM needs for each service
   - Consider auto-scaling requirements

3. **Outline Storage Requirements**
   - Estimate database storage needs
   - Determine file storage requirements
   - Consider data retention policies and archiving needs

4. **Specify Network Requirements**
   - Define bandwidth needs
   - Outline network security requirements (firewalls, VPNs)
   - Determine need for CDN or other content delivery mechanisms

5. **Identify Monitoring and Logging Needs**
   - Select monitoring tools and services
   - Define logging requirements
   - Outline alerting and notification systems

6. **Consider Disaster Recovery and Backup**
   - Define backup strategy and frequency
   - Outline disaster recovery plan
   - Specify RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective)

### Example Output
- List of required server types and specifications
- Storage capacity requirements for databases and file storage
- Network diagram including security components
- Specification of monitoring and logging tools
- Backup and disaster recovery plan outline

## 4. Capacity and Load Estimation

### Objective
Estimate the system's capacity requirements and expected load to ensure adequate resources.

### Process
1. **Define Key Metrics**
   - Identify crucial performance indicators (e.g., requests per second, concurrent users)
   - Determine growth projections for these metrics

2. **Estimate Current Load**
   - Use existing data or market research to estimate initial user base
   - Calculate expected transactions or operations per user
   - Determine peak vs. average load expectations

3. **Project Future Growth**
   - Use growth models to estimate user base over time (e.g., 6 months, 1 year, 3 years)
   - Calculate corresponding increase in transactions and data volume

4. **Perform Capacity Calculations**
   - Estimate required CPU, memory, and storage for current load
   - Project capacity needs based on growth estimates
   - Include overhead for redundancy and unexpected spikes

5. **Consider Performance Requirements**
   - Factor in response time requirements
   - Account for data processing and analytics needs

6. **Document Assumptions**
   - Clearly state all assumptions made in estimations
   - Provide sources for any external data used

### Example Output
- Table of key metrics with current and projected values
- Capacity estimation spreadsheet showing resource needs over time
- Graph of projected growth in users and corresponding resource requirements
- List of assumptions and data sources used in calculations

## 5. Long-Term Infrastructure Planning

### Objective
Develop a strategy for evolving the infrastructure to support product growth over an extended period.

- Decision tree for scaling strategies based on growth scenarios
- List of potential future technologies to evaluate
- Phased plan for geographical expansion if applicable

## 6. Review and Approval Process

1. **Internal Review**

# Getting Started on a New Project

## How to Plan a New Project

Planning a new project involves several key steps:

- Define the project scope and objectives.
- Identify the stakeholders and their roles.
- Establish a timeline for the project.
- Assess the resources required, including personnel, tools, and budget.
- Create a project charter or plan that outlines the above elements.


# Step 0: Setting Up GitHub Repository
Setting up a GitHub repository involves several detailed steps to ensure that the project's source code is managed and version-controlled effectively. Here is a step-by-step guide to get you started:

1. **Create a New Repository:**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in.
   - Click on the "New" button in the repositories section.
   - Name your repository and provide a brief description.
   - Choose whether the repository should be public or private.
   - Initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore (select the appropriate template), and license if applicable.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal.
   - Use the command `git clone <repository-url>` to clone the repository to your local machine.

3. **Set Up Branching Strategy:**
   - Decide on a branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow).
   - Create and switch to a development branch using `git checkout -b develop`.

4. **Add Collaborators:**
   - Go to the repository settings on GitHub.
   - Navigate to the "Collaborators" section.
   - Add team members by their GitHub usernames.

5. **Protect Key Branches:**
   - In the repository settings, go to the "Branches" section.
   - Set up branch protection rules for `main` and `develop` to require pull requests and reviews before merging.

6. **Regular Maintenance:**
   - Regularly pull changes from the repository to keep your local copy up to date.
   - Push your changes frequently to ensure that your work is backed up on GitHub.

This SOP will help maintain consistency and control over the project's codebase, making it easier for team members to collaborate effectively.

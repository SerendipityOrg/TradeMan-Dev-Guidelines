# Coding Conventions and Guidelines

## Git Workflow Guidelines

Establish a standard Git workflow that includes:

- Branching strategies (e.g., feature branches, develop, main).
- Commit message conventions.
- Pull request and code review processes.

## CI/CD Guidelines

### Releases Documentation (releases.md)

Maintain a `releases.md` file that:

- Documents all releases.
- Includes version numbers, release dates, and change logs.
- Provides links to relevant documentation and resources.


### 1. Branching Strategy

- Use the Git Flow branching model:
  - `main`: Represents the official release history
  - `develop`: Serves as an integration branch for features
  - `feature/*`: For developing new features
  - `release/*`: For preparing new production releases
  - `hotfix/*`: For critical bug fixes



### 2. Commit Message Conventions

- Structure commit messages as follows:
Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep the subject line under 50 characters
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why, not how


### 3. Pull Request Process

- Create a pull request for each feature or fix
- Use a PR template that includes:
  - Description of changes
  - Related issue(s)
  - Type of change (bug fix, new feature, etc.)
  - Checklist of completed items
- Require at least one approval before merging
- Squash commits when merging to keep a clean history


### 4. Code Review Guidelines

- Review code within 24 hours of submission
- Focus on:
  - Code quality and readability
  - Adherence to project standards
  - Potential bugs or security issues
  - Performance implications
- Provide constructive feedback
- Use inline comments for specific issues
- Approve only when all comments are resolved


### CI/CD Tools Documentation

Document the CI/CD tools used, including:

- Setup and configuration instructions.
- Guidelines for creating and managing pipelines.
- Best practices for automated testing and deployment.

## Project & File Structure Guidelines

Define a standard project and file structure that:

- Organizes code in a logical and maintainable way.
- Separates concerns (e.g., models, views, controllers).
- Includes directories for tests, documentation, and configuration files.

## Coding Guidelines

Follow coding guidelines that:

- Adhere to industry standards (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
- Include best practices for readability, maintainability, and performance.
- Specify conventions for naming, formatting, and documentation.

## Documentation Guidelines

Ensure thorough and consistent documentation by:

- Using tools like ReadTheDocs or GitBook.
- Writing clear and concise comments and docstrings.
- Maintaining up-to-date documentation for all aspects of the project.
